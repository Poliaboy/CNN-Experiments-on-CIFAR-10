# CNN Experiments on CIFAR-10

This repository is a personal project focused on experimenting with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project is structured around Jupyter notebooks, which provide not only the experimental setup but also deeper explanations of the CIFAR-10 dataset, its features, and the configurations tested in different frameworks. This project is intended for research and personal learning, not for general use.

## Project Origin and Purpose

This project began as part of a school assignment and has since evolved into a research platform. It is designed to deepen my understanding of CNNs by experimenting with different frameworks (such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras) and configurations. Each notebook offers detailed explanations to provide context on the experiments, making it both a practical and educational tool.

## Structure

The project is organized using **Jupyter notebooks**, each dedicated to a different deep learning framework. Each notebook includes:

- **In-depth Analysis of CIFAR-10**: Detailed explanations of the CIFAR-10 dataset, including its structure, features, and challenges associated with image classification tasks.
- **Framework-Specific Experiments**: Tests and experiments conducted using frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras.
- **Configurations and Tests**: Each notebook explores various CNN configurations (learning rate, optimizer choices, architectures) and logs the outcomes of these experiments.
- **Explanations**: Alongside the code, the notebooks provide detailed explanations of the methods, thought processes behind each experiment, and insights gained from the results.

## CIFAR-10 Dataset

CIFAR-10 is a widely used dataset in image classification, consisting of 60,000 color images categorized into 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The notebooks include detailed explanations of the dataset, covering topics such as:

- Image size and resolution
- Dataset structure and splits (train/test)
- Challenges related to CIFAR-10, such as inter-class similarities
- Preprocessing steps like normalization and data augmentation

## How to Explore

This project is meant for personal research and learning. To explore the notebooks:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/cnn-cifar10-experiments.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Open the Jupyter notebooks for each framework:
    - `cnn_tensorflow.ipynb`
    - `cnn_pytorch.ipynb`
    - `cnn_keras.ipynb`

Each notebook walks through the CIFAR-10 dataset, setting up experiments with different configurations, and explains the results and insights.
